This folder contains the codes that can be used to clean the raw data and produce a tidy dataset (capital_punishment_cleanup.R), make an exploratory 
analysis using the clean dataset and also to build the final model (capital_punishment_analysis.R) and finally to produce the pdf report that contains
the analysis and its results (capital_punishment_markdown.Rmd). 

Note that the Rmd file should only be used to produce pdf files since I have used some verbs from LaTeX to change the design of the document.
